# DataStructure-And-Algorithms
## I have made the collection of all the data-structure and algorithm question which are present in LeetCode and Code Studio and are important for practice to crack coding tests.

- The language used in these questions is Java (which is my favourite one in addition to Python)
- The list is updated daily with the questions I practice.
